# Title of the Project
**Covipred** : Covid-19 Predictions using Symptoms
# Description
The idea we've implemented in this web app is that the user will first register, and afterwards receive a signup confirmation email. After logging in, users can check covid-19 or SARS-COV-2 based on their symptoms. If a user's covid-19 test results are positive, a RT-PCR test is recommended. If the user's covid-19 test result is negative, we propose that they look at our home isolation tips (pdf). Even if a user does not want to check covid-19 presence and only wants to see home isolation tips, they can do so without logging in by clicking on home isolation tips on the navigation bar.

The model we built provides initial COVID-19 test screening based on simple clinical signs and symptoms. Improving clinical priorities may lower the burden currently faced by
health systems.
